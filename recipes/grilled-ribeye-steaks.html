    <h1>Grilled Ribeye Steaks</h1>

    <p>This recipe shows my technique for grilling ribeye steaks, from marinade to grill marks.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons carne asada seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) boneless ribeye steak</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine lime juice, carne asada seasoning, and oil in a resealable plastic bag. 
            Add ribeye steak, reseal the bag, and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain marinade and allow steak to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. 
            Blot any excess moisture off the steak.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the grill to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C), and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place steak on the grill over direct heat. For rare: cook steaks until browned on the 
            outside and red in the center, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer 
            inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
